**Tell us about the problem you are currently facing**
_Currently, There's No option to search packages based on certain filters such as maintainenance status, popularity level and Dart 3 compatibility which is making it little difficult to choose a overall good package._

**Describe the solution/feature you'd like us to add**
_We need a filter button and a sort dropdown to make the website more user friendly and to enhance the overall user experience_

**Any other feedback you would like to provide regarding the site**
_The current choice boxes to filter based on the platoform is good, it can persist, an extra filter button might make it even better_
